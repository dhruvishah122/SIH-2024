                        Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refer to the legal protections granted to creators and inventors for their original works and inventions. These rights cover various types of creations, including patents for inventions, copyrights for literary and artistic works, trademarks for brand names and logos, and trade secrets for confidential business information. IPR helps safeguard the interests of creators by giving them exclusive rights to use, produce, and license their works, thus encouraging innovation and creativity. Enforcement of IPR ensures that unauthorized use or reproduction of protected works is prevented, maintaining the value and originality of intellectual creations.
